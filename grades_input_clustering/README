Student Grade Grouping using Clustering

This mini machine learning project uses [grades_km_input.csv] (https://github.com/mlnjsh/DSBDA-Btech/blob/master/grades_km_input.csv) from the DSBDA-Btech repository to group student grades using clustering techniques.

Technologies:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
matplotlib
scikit-learn

How it works:
Loads the dataset from the provided CSV link and imports relevant libraries
Computes average silhouette scores for cluster counts ranging from 2 to 15
Selects the optimal number of clusters based on the highest silhouette score
Applies K-Means clustering to group the dataset
Interprets cluster groupings
